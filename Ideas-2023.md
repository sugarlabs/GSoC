## Improve and maintain 12 Sugar activities

**Prerequisites**<br>
 - Experience with Python
 - Strong experience with Sugar activities
 - Experience with maintaining activities on ASLO and ASLO-v4

**Description**<br>
Sugar has a lot of activities, with 250+ on GitHub, and more
elsewhere. These have scope for improvement; bugs,
features, updated human translations, and release.  This project will involve
working on **at least 12** activities to improve them. Students can choose
activities on their own, and are encouraged to select activities which
are either a part of Fructose or have a strong pedagogical value. To
understand how to locate and work on activities, see our guide to
[Modifying
Activities](https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar-docs/blob/master/src/contributing.md#modifying-activities)

In their proposal, students may mention _some_ of the issues they will
work on.  Any new feature suggestion should be discussed on GitHub
Issues or on the mailing list before being added to a proposal.

Since there are a lot of activities to work on, **more than one instance
of this project may be selected**.

**Suggested Issues to work on:**<br>
 - jukebox-activity: [#22 Add collaboration for sharing playlist items](https://github.com/sugarlabs/jukebox-activity/issues/22)

Other issues will have been raised since.

Suggesting or adding features, fixing bugs, or releasing activities

## Port Sugar and core activities to Python 3

**Prerequisites**<br>
 - Experience with Python
 - Experience with porting telepathy bindings
 - Strong experience with
   [Sugar Desktop](https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar) and [Activities](https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar-docs/blob/master/src/contributing.md#modifying-activities)


**Description**<br> Support for Python 2 was withdrawn by the Python
Foundation, so we need to finish the move to Python 3.  The move was
started in GSoC 2018, and continued in GSoC 2020, but there is still
work to be done.  Sugar 0.116 runs on Python 2 or Python 3.  Core
activities run on Python 3.  Many other activities run on Python 2.
Many regressions have been seen as a result of code not being tested.

We have a [Python 3 Porting
Guide](https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar-docs/blob/master/src/python-porting-guide.md)
which describes the process for activities.

**Project Task Checklist**<br>
 - Review the Sugar source code changes since 0.112 that were made for porting to Python 3,
 - Design tests and iterate until the tests have sufficient [coverage](https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar-docs/blob/master/src/python-coverage-guide.md) for the code changes identified about,
 - Fix regressions in Sugar, the Toolkit, and the Datastore,
 - For affected activities, port Telepathy bindings to TelepathyGLib, see [Port to TelepathyGLib](https://github.com/orgs/sugarlabs/projects/4).
 - For affected activities, port to the latest Sugargame or CollabWrapper library,
 - Port activities to Python 3, fixing any problems that prevent them from being ported or used,

See GitHub Project [Port to Python 3 via
six](https://github.com/orgs/sugarlabs/projects/1) for some open
issues and pull requests.  Most activities do not have issues.  Some
activities have problems that prevent them from being ported.

The Telepathy library is used by some activities for network
collaboration between Sugar users.  The library does not have static
bindings for Python 3, so porting Telepathy to the PyGObject binding
is a prerequisite, see GitHub Project [Port to
TelepathyGLib](https://github.com/orgs/sugarlabs/projects/4).

# Maintain Port 12 Sugar Activities to Flatpak

**Prerequisites**<br>
 - Experience with Python
 - Strong experience with
   [Sugar Desktop](https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar) and [Activities](https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar-docs/blob/master/src/contributing.md#modifying-activities)

**Description**<br>We have a number of Sugar Activities bundled with
  [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/) as a way to reach a broader audience
  within the Linux community. We'd like to both keep those activities
  up to date and also port more.

Two quite popular acitivities are
[Pippy](https://beta.flathub.org/apps/details/org.sugarlabs.Pippy) and
[Physics](https://beta.flathub.org/apps/details/org.sugarlabs.Physics). Both
of these activities are using an unsupported version of pygame, so
they can no longer be updated. The first goal, then, of this project
would be to port these activities to pygame-2.0. Then, repackage them.

From there, we'd love to add more Sugar activities to the Flatpak
collection.

It would also be nice to include the physics plugin with the
TurtleBlocks Flatpak bundle, since it offers another fun way to create
projects for the Physics activity mentioned above.

# Music Blocks 4 Project Builder Integration

**Difficulty:** &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9734;

**Project Length:** **350** hours

**Prerequisites**

* Strong experience with TypeScript 4
* Strong experience with JavaScript DOM API, Canvas API
* Strong experience with React Functional Components and Hooks (React 18)
* Understanding of the prototype
[**Project Builder Framework**](https://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks-v4-builder-framework)

**Description**

The objective is to build the new _Project Builder Framework_ for _Music Blocks_ (_v4_).
The _Project Builder_ is the graphical blocks manager module which can be used to
create _Music Blocks_ programs. There is a prototype in
[`musicblocks-v4-builder-framework`](https://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks-v4-builder-framework).

General objectives are:

* Refactor the prototype code
* Integrate it in `musicblocks-v4`
* Create a wrapper component _Project Builder_ (_builder_) in `musicblocks-v4`
* Add utilities to the wrapper component so that the _Project Builder_ component
can communicate with the _Specification_ and _Syntax Tree_ APIs of the
[**Programming Framework**](https://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks-v4-lib)
* Create a _Palette_ (_palette_) component

# Music Blocks 4 Widgets Framework

**Difficulty:** &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9734; &#9734;

**Project Length:** **175** hours

**Prerequisites**

* Good experience with TypeScript 4
* Good experience with React Functional Components and Hooks (React 18)

**Description**

In Music Blocks,
[Widgets](https://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/blob/master/guide/README.md#4-widgets)
are tools that expose powerful ideas in music, such as rhythm, mode,
temperament, etc. In Music Blocks v3, Widgets are subclessed from a
common
[framwwork](https://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/blob/master/js/widgets/widgetWindows.js). They
are launched from the blocks language itself so that Widget parameters
can be programmed in the block language too -- although this is
feature that adds lots of complexity to the code -- we will not
support this in v4). However, a very important feature is that Widgets
generate code as an output.

The first order of business is to build a widget framework that
involves the main widget window and its paraphernalia, and integration
hooks to the Singer API.  The individual widgets will be built on top
of that.

Priorities for the summer would be:

* the framework

* Rhythm Maker (drum machines)

* Musical Mode

* Phrase Maker

# Music Blocks 4 Programming Framework Enhancements

**Difficulty:** &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9734;

**Project Length:** **350** hours

**Prerequisites**

* Strong experience with TypeScript 4
* Experience of writing tests using Jest
* Good understanding of the JavaScript Event Loop

**Description**

There are three parts to this project:

* Improvements and optimizations to the Program Syntax Framework
* Enhancements and performance optimizations to the Execution Engine
* Addition of Telemetry and Debugging support

We need to revisit some design considerations made while initially building the
Program Syntax Framework. This framework is responsible for defining the business
logic and rules for units of a program's syntax (literals, expressions, statements,
blocks, functions) and maintaining the Syntax Tree that represents a program.
There's scope for some work to be done in it's refinement.

The Execution Engine handles the runtime behavior of a program. Currently, it is
in a very rudimentary state and is a work-in-progress. The goal is to build a low
overhead interpreter that supports pseudo real-time and concurrency. Of course,
JavaScript is single-threaded and the JavaScript engine on the browser doesn't
support concurrency. So, we'll have to mock a closer behavior with Events.

It is desirable to be able to monitor the runtime states of an executing program.
We want to collect execution information, messages, errors while a program is
executing, and also control the execution itself. The goal is to add support for
the said.

The framework code is contained in
[github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks-v4-lib](https://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks-v4-lib).

- First screen
- Login 
- Home view 
- List view 
- Settings 

Each screen should integrate unit testing and code coverage.

**First steps to starts**<br>

- Complete both the [Sugarizer Vanilla Javascript activity development tutorial](https://github.com/llaske/sugarizer/blob/dev/docs/tutorial/VanillaJS/tutorial.md) and the [Sugarizer Vue.js activity development tutorial](https://github.com/llaske/sugarizer/blob/dev/docs/tutorial/VueJS/tutorial.md).
- Explore the [VueJS Sugarizer UI components](https://github.com/S-kus/Sugarizer_vueJs) and try to use it in a web page.
- Read and test the L10N study [here](https://github.com/llaske/l10nstudy) because the first step of the project will be to create a localization component.

Specifically, the goal of this project is to:

- Develop a new Chart activity
- Add a new template Word Puzzle for Exerciser activity 
<br>
 

**Tasks**<br> 

*Chart Activity*

The Chart activity will be inspired by the [Sugar Chart activity](https://help.sugarlabs.org/chart.html).  

![](assets/chart-sugar.png)

The detailed features will be discussed with the project mentor but the new activity will at least reproduce current features of the activity and add new features (share the activity, export chart as image, ...).


*Word Puzzle template*

The new template Word Puzzle in Exerciser activity will enable a teacher to create word puzzles Exercise by inputting custom words on the go during a lesson and have the learners practice. 

The new template will allow to type words by text, images, sounds, speech or videos. It should work with the mouse and on touch devices.

![](assets/wordpuzzle.png)

The detailed features will be discussed with the project mentor but the new template will reproduce current features (edit, play, share, view results, convert to evaluation, ...) of other templates in Exerciser.

It's possible to take inspiration for this new template from [Learning Apps web site](https://learningapps.org/) which propose a Word Puzzle template too.

**First steps to starts**<br>

- Complete both the [Sugarizer Vanilla Javascript activity development tutorial](https://github.com/llaske/sugarizer/blob/dev/docs/tutorial/VanillaJS/tutorial.md) and the [Sugarizer Vue.js activity development tutorial](https://github.com/llaske/sugarizer/blob/dev/docs/tutorial/VueJS/tutorial.md).

## Sugar on Raspberry Pi

**Prerequisites**<br>

**Project length**<br>
**175** hours

**Difficulty**<br>

**Easy**

**Description**<br>
Sugar runs on RPi and we should take advantage of that to reach the
Maker community. This project involves ensuring that Sugar runs w/o
any issues; that it is packaged in a way that is suiable for inclusion
on the [Raspberry Pi operating system images](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/).
Also, there are any number of Sugar activities that could be enhanced by
knowing some of the details of the RPi, such as Turtle Blocks,
Measure, and Pippy, all of which could be tailored to take advantage
of the sensors available on RPi.

# Administrative notes

Above are a list of ideas we've planned for GSoC 2023 projects.
If you have any ideas which can be useful to us, but are not in the
list, we'd love to hear from you.  You need not be a potential
student or a mentor to suggest ideas.

   * [Criteria for Ideas](#criteria-for-ideas)
   * [Coding Mentors](#coding-mentors)
   * [Assisting Mentors](#assisting-mentors)
   * [Everyone Else](#everyone-else)
   * [Suggested Issues](#suggested-issues)

## Criteria for Ideas
1. Does it fill an empty pedagogy niche in the activity set for Sugar
   or Sugarizer,
2. Does it increase quality of our software products (Sugar, activities,
   Music Blocks, or Sugarizer),
3. Does it _not_ involve any project infrastructure, e.g. not another
   app store, web site, or developer landing page,
4. Do we have a developer _now_ who would be willing and able to do it
   if a student was not available, and who can _promise_ to do it if a
   student is not selected; these are shown as a _coding mentor_,

## Coding Mentors
For each idea, we must have offers from one or more _coding mentors_
willing and able to assist students with coding questions.

Requirements for a _coding mentor_ are a demonstrated coding ability
in the form of contributions of code to Sugar Labs.

Mentors for a project will be assigned after proposals are received.

## Assisting Mentors For each idea, we may have offers from
mentors _who do not code_ willing to assist students in various
other ways, such as gathering requirements, visual design,
testing, and deployment; these are shown as an _assisting
mentor_.

The only requirement for an _assisting mentor_ is _knowledge of
the project_.

Mentors for a project will be assigned after proposals are received.

## Everyone Else

Everyone else in Sugar Labs may also be involved with these
projects, through mailing lists, Wiki, and GitHub.

The difference between a _mentor_ and _everyone else_, is that a
_mentor_ is obliged to respond when a student has a question,
even if the answer is "I don't know."

When a _mentor_ receives a question for which the best forum is
_everyone else_, then they are to respectively redirect the
student to ask _everyone else_.  See [Be
flexible](https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar-docs/blob/master/src/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#be-flexible)
and [When you are unsure, ask for
help](https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar-docs/blob/master/src/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#when-you-are-unsure-ask-for-help)
in our Code of Conduct.

## Suggested Issues

For some ideas, there is a list of 'Suggested issues to work on'.
These may help you to get familiar with the project.  The more
you work on these issues, the more experienced you will be for
the project.  However, this is not a strict list.  You _should_
try and explore other issues as well.
