# Proposal Template:
A good proposal is structured, complete and backed by your code contributions ;-). We want you to be honest and realistic while writing your proposal.<br>
You must also use [Google's guide to Writing a Proposal](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal)

It's good to have a well spaced timeline with doable goals for each week and buffers for each task. If you end up not being able to complete what you proposed, then we might consider failing your project.

```
Hofstadter's Law: It takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law
```

Finish writing your proposal early so that you can get it reviewed by your mentors and the community, before the deadline. They can give you valuable suggestions on your timeline and project details.

This is a sample template. You can add other sections which you think add value to your proposal

---------------
## Basic Details
 - Full Name
 - Email and GitHub Username
 - Your first language
 - Location and Timezone
 - Share links, if any, of your previous work on open source projects ?
 - Convince us that you will be a good fit for this project, by sharing links to your contribution to Sugar Labs


## Project Details
 - What are you making ? 
 - How will it impact Sugar Labs ?
 - What technologies (programming languages, etc.) will you be using ?

## Timeline:
 - Break down the entire projects into chunks and tell us what will you work on each week.<br>
   As the summer goes on, you and your mentor will adjust your schedule, but it's good to have a plan at the beginning so you have an idea of where you're headed.
 - If you will be off-the-grid for a few days, then mention those in the timeline.
 - GSoC has three evaluations, once after every 30 days. Highlight the work you plan to complete before each evaluation.
 - How many hours will you spend each week on your project ?
 - Discuss your post GSoC plans. Will you continue contributing to Sugar Labs after GSOC ends ?
