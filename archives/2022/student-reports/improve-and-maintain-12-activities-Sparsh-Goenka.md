## My work in project

My work involves adding features to various activities, improving the user interface and design, porting activities to python3, adding textures, and other bug fixes. It also includes making the code more efficent and compact, making activity releases on ASLOv4, fixing known issues and texting the activities extensively.
## Work Completed

Here is a brief description for my work. I have provided link to my pull requests for future reference.

## Personal note

It was fun being a part of sugarlabs :D

I really enjoy doing open source contributions and seeing my work being used by people all over the world. Thanks to [Ibiam Chihurumnaya](https://github.com/chimosky/), [Srevin Saju](https://github.com/chimosky/) 
and [James Cameron](https://github.com/quozl) for their help and guidance throughout the summer.
